# PyBer_Analysis

### Overview of the Analysis: 
In this project, PyBer, a ride sharing company asked our team to analyze their customer data to improve their accessibility and pricing in underserved neighborhoods. We analyzed the data by city type: urban, suburban, and rural. We created three dataframes for each city type and compared total weekly fares across the different cities using a multi-line graph.

### Results: 
#### Fare Summary Analysis: 
* Overall, Urban cities had the most rides (1,625) and brought the highest revenue at $39,854.38.
* Suburban cities had the second most rides (625), but had a higher average fare per ride at $30.97 and the higher average fare per driver at $2.26.
* Rural cities accumulated the least amouunt of revenue at $4,327.93, but the highest average fare per ride at $32.62.

#### Total Fares by City Type:
* As seen in the graph below, Urban cities had three peaks in revenue from the end of February until the middle of March. 
* Urban cities also had a consistent revenue path leading from April into May. 
* Suburban and Rural cities had similar peaks at the end of Februrary. 
* Suburban cities had a spike in fares in the middle of April and leading in to May.

### Summary: 
Overall, urban cities bring in the most revenue, and therefore the company should continue to invest in these cities as they consistently outperform other city types. However, I also recommend PyBer to consider investing in more drivers in the suburban cities during the summer months, as it appears their revenue increases after April. Rural cities consistently perform the least but bring in the highest price per fare. They also have a couple of peeks in revenue at the end of February and the beginning of April. With that in mind, I recommend PyBer further analyze these peaks and consider lowering their fare price as an incentive for riders to use their service.
